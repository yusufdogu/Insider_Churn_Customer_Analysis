# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Analysis â€” Insider

This project focuses on analyzing and understanding the **customer churn problem at Insider**.

Customer churn â€” when users stop using a product or service â€” is a critical issue for any SaaS company aiming to grow sustainably. In this project, we examined Insiderâ€™s datasets to uncover patterns and signals that could help predict and reduce churn.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The primary goal of this analysis was to **identify why customers leave** and to generate **actionable insights** for increasing retention and long-term revenue (MRR). We focused on understanding:

- How customer characteristics differ between churned and retained users  
- What behavioral patterns are associated with churn  
- Which specific features or services might influence loyalty

## ðŸ§  Our Approach

We analyzed multiple datasets provided by Insider, including:

- **Survey responses** from users about usability and satisfaction  
- **Customer profile information** such as industry, level, and region  
- **Engagement metrics** like support requests, product usage, and newsletter interaction  

We then compared churned and retained customers to spot trends, inconsistencies, and opportunities for improvement.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- Churned customers tend to be lower-tier clients with less frequent platform usage  
- Even customers who churned didnâ€™t always report dissatisfaction, suggesting silent churn risks  
- Many at-risk users had trouble with data reporting features  
- Timely, targeted engagement and education may help reduce churn

## âœ… Outcome

The insights from this analysis can be used to:

- Build better retention strategies  
- Offer more personalized customer support and onboarding  
- Improve satisfaction with key features  
- Prioritize product improvements that align with long-term user value
